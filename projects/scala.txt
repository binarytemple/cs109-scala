In this course, I plan to use the Scala programming language.

In my experience, students develop a style of programming in their
first programming language. They find it difficult to learn a
different style later, even if they switch to a different
language. This means that students should start early to use a modern
language that encourages writing clean and elegant code, and supports
a good object-oriented and functional style.

I therefore want to try using Scala this semester. Scala is not yet a
popular or successful language (although I believe it will be), and so
most students will have to learn C++ and/or Java later during
their studies--but I believe that after getting programming practice
in Scala, they will be able to write better code in those languages as
well.
